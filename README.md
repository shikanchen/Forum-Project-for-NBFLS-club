## Forum-Project-for-NBFLS-club
This is a project I worked on in high school, [Ningbo Foreign Language School](http://www.nwgjb.com/en/index.aspx). This project aims to practice full stack development skills, including back end interface implementation, database model design and front end design with Bootstrap framework. The project is a forum platform for members of computer club at my high school. Some design ideas are from Reddit. This is my first time developing on full stack website on my own, so I achived it on GitHub for memorial purposes.
